# Casino Game v1.0

My first self-written Java program: a simple betting game.
You start with 100$, bet an amount, and guess a number from 1 to 10.

This project is for learning purposes and still needs improvements like:
- Proper win calculation
- Better error handling

To run:
Compile with `javac CasinoGame.java` and run with `java CasinoGame`.
